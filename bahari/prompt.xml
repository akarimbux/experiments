        - parse a template price list pdf file (supplied as an attachment in this chat)
            - ignore all logos as we will provide our own
        - create a workflow that will support additional functionality specified in the <functionality> tag
        - output the final price list in pdf format to adhere to the input formatting
    </objective>
    <functionality>
        - I would be able to update all products pricing based on a new exchange rate
            - make sure to keep track of the different input currencies
        - I would be able to update an individual product price based on VAT tax (yes/no - to apply 18% to price)
        - I would be able to add a new product in any section (the product list will be divided by section - i.e. Shellfish separate from say Whole Fish)
        - I would be able to update an individual product price based on the cost of the individual product abroad
        - I would be able to update an individual product price based on the margin that I want for that product

            - a price list tab which mimics the data contents of the template pdf, such that
                - that nested structure of category/sub-category is maintained for example Salmon (Salmo salar) / Salmon whole
                - allow creation of new categories and sub-categories
            - a preview tab which shows the expected output, which includes the expected output and a print pdf button
